    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <div id="osParagraphs">
        <p>
            We met in the Cayman Islands back in January 2016 where we had both just joined at Deloitte. Our whole first year
            Deloitte group went out to dinner that first week and then played Rock n Roll bingo at a local pub where we got to
            chatting and the rest is history!
        </p>
        <p>
            Since our “meet cute” in Cayman, we have built a holiday cottage in Rustico, Prince Edward Island, travelled a
            little bit of Europe, the US and Cuba along with visiting both our hometowns each year and made it through COVID and
            lockdowns together (Jamie is a very patient, laid back person). We also welcomed our baby boy, Riley Michael Lawlor
            on 12 August 2022 into the world and he is very excited to celebrate with us at our wedding.

            In December 2019, Jamie got down on one knee and popped the question at Mkuze Falls Private Game Reserve in KZN
            whilst we were on a drinks stop in the bush. We have been waiting to celebrate our big day with everyone ever
            since!! Let the countdown to the celebrations begin!
