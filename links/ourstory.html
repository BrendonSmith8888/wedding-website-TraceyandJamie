    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <div id="osParagraphs">
        <p>
            We met in the Cayman Islands back in January 2016 where we had both just joined at Deloitte. Our whole first
            year Deloitte group went out to dinner that first week and then played Rock n Roll bingo at a local pub
            where we
            got to chatting and the rest is history!
        </p>
        <p>
            Jamie is from Prince Edward Islands (“PEI”) in Canada and before Cayman, went to school in the United States
            for
            some of his college years playing tennis and studying before he finished up his CPA qualification
            (accounting)
            back in his hometown. Tracey is from Durban, South Africa, went to university in Grahamstown and then
            finished
            up her CA qualification (accounting) back in Durban.

            Since our “meet cute” in Cayman, we have built a holiday cottage in Rustico, PEI, travelled a little bit of
            Europe, the US and Cuba along with visiting both our hometowns each year and made it through COVID and
            lockdowns
            together (Jamie is a very patient, laid back person).

            In December 2019, Jamie got down on one knee and popped the question at Mkuze Falls Private Game Reserve in
            KZN
            whilst we were on a drinks stop in the bush. We have been waiting to celebrate our big day with everyone
            ever
            since (along with the arrival of our baby in August 2022) and both are finally happening!! Let the countdown
            to
            the celebrations begin!
